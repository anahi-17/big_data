## Homework 1
### Types of machine learning algorithms
1. Regression algorithms. They help us classify or predict values. An attempt will be made to compensate for the best
response from the smallest error.
2. Bayesian algorithms
These types of algorithms by classification are included in Bayes' theorem and
they classify each value as independent of any other. What allows to predict
a class or category based on a given set of characteristics, using
probability
3. Grouping algorithms
They are used in unsupervised learning, and are used to categorize data that is not
tagged, that is, data without specific categories or groups.
The algorithm works by searching for groups within the data, with the
number of groups represented by variable K.
4. Decision tree algorithms
A decision tree is a tree structure similar to a flowchart that
uses a branching method to illustrate every possible outcome of a decision.
Each node within the tree represents a test on a specific variable, and
each branch is the result of that test.
5. Neural network algorithms.
Neural Networks mimic biological activation behavior and
interconnection between neurons to find non-linear solutions to problems
complex.
6. Dimension reduction algorithms
Dimension reduction reduces the number of variables considered for
find the exact information required.
Dimension reduction allows us to graph or simplify very complex models
that in their initial condition contained too many characteristics.
7. Deep Learning Algorithms
Deep learning algorithms execute data across multiple layers of
neural network algorithms, which pass to a simplified representation
from the data to the next layer.
Convolutional networks make a deep learning neural network
have the ability to recognize animals, humans and objects within images.
